        					<p><strong>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</strong> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.</p>

        					<p><strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong>is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). </p>

        					<p><strong>Javascript</strong> often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>

        					<p><strong>AngularJS</strong>  is an open source Model-View-Controller framework which is similar to the JavaScript framework.Angular JS is probably one of the most popular modern day web frameworks available today. This framework is used for developing mostly Single Page applications. This framework has been developed by a group of developers from Google itself.Because of the sheer support of Google and ideas from a wide community forum, the framework is always kept up to date. Also, it always incorporates the latest development trends in the market..</p>

        					<p><strong> Node.js </strong> is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment used for the development of server-side web applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript and can be run on a wide variety of operating systems.Node.js is based on an event-driven architecture and a non-blocking Input/Output API that is designed to optimize an application's throughput and scalability for real-time web applications.A lot of work had to be done to maintain the session information between requests for a user. But with Node.js, there is finally a way for web applications to have real-time two-way connections, where both the client and server can initiate communication, allowing them to exchange data freely.</p>

        					<p><strong> ReactJS  </strong>is an open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces. ReactJS is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. It is widely used as a base in building single-page websites and mobile applications. ReactJS is JavaScript library used for building reusable UI components.React is a library for building composable user interfaces. It encourages the creation of reusable UI components, which present data that changes over time. Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. React abstracts away the DOM from you, offering a simpler programming model and better performance. React can also render on the server using Node, and it can power native apps using React Native.</p>

        					<p><strong>Java</strong> is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.

        					<p><strong>PHP</strong> is a general-purpose scripting language especially suited to web development.It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994;the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code â which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data â would form the whole or part of a HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response..</p>

        					<p><strong> My SQL </strong> is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter,and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language. A relational database organizes data into one or more data tables in which data types may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data. SQL is a language programmers use to create, modify and extract data from the relational database, as well as control user access to the database. In addition to relational databases and SQL, an RDBMS like MySQL works with an operating system to implement a relational database in a computer's storage system, manages users, allows for network access and facilitates testing database integrity and creation of backups.MySQL is free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License, and is also available under a variety of proprietary licenses.</p>
